# nextjs-website
Website sample built using Next.js and Prismic

Follows the recommendations of https://nextjs.org/docs/#custom-server-and-routing and uses node to handle custom routing for the different pages, along with previews/drafts.
Production ready and can be hosted in any service that can run node.

This is ugly placeholder and will be more detailed once I figure how to merge both approaches at local custom routing (`now dev` and `node server.js`)
