# nextjs-website
Website sample built using Next.js and Prismic

Ready for serverless Now deployments using the now-cli. Routing will work on server.
To test on development environment, use npm run local instead.
npm run dev will use next. Client side routing works, but custom routing will not.
npm run start will fail until now dev is production ready.

This means server.js is a local development only necessity for now. Will be updated as soon as possible.
